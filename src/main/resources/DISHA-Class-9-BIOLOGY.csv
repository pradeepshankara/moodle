7,Origin of Life,Assertion and Reason ,,1,"Assertion : Primary atmosphere of primitive earth was reducing.
Reason : Primary atmosphere had abundance of NH~3*, CH~4*, CO~2* but had no free O~2*","Both A and R are true and R is correct explanation of the
Assertion",Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of the Assertion,A is true but R is false,A is false but R is true,,a,,AR
7,Origin of Life,Assertion and Reason ,,2,"Assertion : Homologous organs serve the different function and look alike, but have same embryonic
origin.
Reason : Homologous organs have specific significance","Both A and R are true and R is correct explanation of the
Assertion",Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of the Assertion,A is true but R is false,A is false but R is true,,b,,AR
7,Origin of Life,Assertion and Reason ,,3,"Assertion : The first living organisms were heterotrophs 
Reason : They were surrounded by preformed organic molecules which they used as food.","Both A and R are true and R is correct explanation of the
Assertion",Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of the Assertion,A is true but R is false,A is false but R is true,,a,,AR
7,Origin of Life,Assertion and Reason ,,4,"Assertion : Organic compounds gradually accumulated in the ocean
Reason : These were pre-determined as oceans favoured their growth.","Both A and R are true and R is correct explanation of the
Assertion",Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of the Assertion,A is true but R is false,A is false but R is true,,c,,AR
7,Origin of Life,Assertion and Reason ,,5,"Assertion : A single mutation may produce a new species.
Reason : Mutations cause variation in chromosomes and genes and are, therefore, inheritable.","Both A and R are true and R is correct explanation of the
Assertion",Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of the Assertion,A is true but R is false,A is false but R is true,,a,,AR
7,Origin of Life,Assertion and Reason ,,6,"Assertion : Acquired characters are non-inheritable.
Reason : Acquired characters generally affect the somatic cells and it is the germ cells that are passed on to the next generation.","Both A and R are true and R is correct explanation of the
Assertion",Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of the Assertion,A is true but R is false,A is false but R is true,,a,,AR
7,Origin of Life,Assertion and Reason ,,7,"Assertion : Man has descended from apes.
Reason : Monkeys resemble humans more than apes do.","Both A and R are true and R is correct explanation of the
Assertion",Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of the Assertion,A is true but R is false,A is false but R is true,,c,,AR
7,Origin of Life,Assertion and Reason ,,8,"Assertion : Homologous organs are similar in basic structure and embryonic origin, but serve different
functions.
Reason : Similarity in basic structure points to common ancestry whereas diversity in function retlects
adaptation to different modes of life.","Both A and R are true and R is correct explanation of the
Assertion",Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of the Assertion,A is true but R is false,A is false but R is true,,a,,AR
7,Origin of Life,Assertion and Reason ,,9,"Assertion: Vestigial organs are greatly reduced and functionless.
Reason : These organs were fully developed and functional in the ancestral forms, but are gradually
disappearing due to change in the mode of life of their descendants","Both A and R are true and R is correct explanation of the
Assertion",Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of the Assertion,A is true but R is false,A is false but R is true,,a,,AR
